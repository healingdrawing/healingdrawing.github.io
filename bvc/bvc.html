          generally allow training the moves. Training each move can be more difficult than match game play process, because, in match game process, to keep the flow, was added early touch delay. This allow you touch to defense, little bit earlier than attack was executed, and your player reaction will fast as possible
        </li>
        <li>
          to execute attack in jump in training mode, you must touch/click on screen in time when ball close to highest point, but in match mode you can touch/click on screen before ball fly close to high point, which is much more comfort

<li>when android device locked manually and unlocked, in time of match, there is lags often, ball freezing or characters disappear. That fix it, out in menu and start match again.</li>
<li>some vibrations and sliding when action time not enough long, for comfort switching;</li>
<li>detected AI digging and fail with defense, after later user blocking, when ball sound play "bang" , but trajectory not changed;</li>
<li>once crush first time "training 1 move &rarr; item" pressed, or "story &rarr; choose level". After second and later app starts, all ok. This detected only with obfuscated version;</li>
<li>detected digging and no toss from AI side, after : player &rarr; blocking prepare &rarr; move to defense &rarr; success defense &rarr; then AI confused and vibrate (once detected);</li>
<li>detected in manual mode, player move on place after partner good defense, and ball fall to ground. After wrong(early) touch before serve beginned, when partner execute defense, but player action was executed too by user touch screen;</li>
<li>detected animation vibration, in side change flow;</li>
<li>android - different cpu speed can produce different deviation of AI behavior, up to "super skill" for serve(slow cpu case), when AI several times in a row execute: serve &rarr; net &rarr; enemy side &rarr; very hard to defense.</li>
<li>android - after match done &rarr; go back into menu , the banner still displayed (once detected). Go to match again and exit again. This hide banner . This safe for your progress etc.</li>
