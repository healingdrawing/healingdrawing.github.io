    AI prime place(the place of your team partner before enemy serve will executed), controlled automatically, but
    deviation can be
    controlled using "PARTNER" menu.

    <br><br><img src="../img/user-prime/image-prime-place.png">

    <br><br>From left to right variants means:
    <ul>
      <li>similar as PLAYER along X axis, and parallel along Y axis, with some restrictions. Also with this scheme AI
        will try switch user on blocking, after serve will executed, as possible, while AI have enough skill power.</li>
      <li>similar as PLAYER along X axis, and mirrored along Y axis. Also with this scheme AI will try switch user on
        blocking, after serve will executed, as possible, while AI have enough skill power.</li>
      <li>placement close to serve area, and close to center of court along Y axis.</li>
      <li>placement close to side line along Y axis, far from serve area.</li>
      <li>placement close to court corner, balanced.</li>
    </ul>

    Defense position of AI character, when enemy execute attack, will be controlled automatically, depends on
    enemy
    team toss direction.

    <br><br>When enemy team toss directed close to center court area along Y axis, defender will move close to center
    too, to
    try cover maximum area for weak attack or forward attack.

    <br><br>When enemy team toss directed close to side line of court area along Y axis, defender will move diagonally
    in most
    of cases, to try cover maximum area of attack.
