    For convenient communication between cities (using straight-line roads), cities can be disigned similar to
    the
    correct octagon.

    <br><br>The permitted speed of movement within the city is from 0 to 6 [m / s]. For the movement of cars on the
    internal
    roads of the city, all parallel internal roads of one direction are simultaneously opened, then all parallel

    <br><br>Let's be honest, no one needs dog's shit on their boot, or watch dog shit if he doesn't ask for
    it. Not pets, rats, pigeons, flies and others, do their job well. There is no need to help them damage the
    infrastructure and create emergency situations in which others may suffer. If you want a meat toy, keep it inside
    your house, or do it outside the city, in the countryside, where cows, sheep, more freedom for adventure lovers.
