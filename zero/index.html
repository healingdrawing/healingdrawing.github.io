      Can be useful for the grit:lab pisciners, who does not have any coding background.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      More simple(user friendly) methods to do common stuff. Can safe your time at the beginning, in case you have zero skills in coding and vscode.
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      Use terminal only when it is required(for quests and tasks). Terminal not the most user friendly interface, and any mistyping can easily harm your repository.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      More safe way to manage repository is make "clone", "pull", "commit", "push" commands using <b> vscode (visual studio code) </b> - the lightweight ide already installed on macos workstations(your computers). It does not break any rules.
    </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Copy all your solutions into github repository, because gitea account not available remotely</b>, so you can not learn the code before sleep from your place(outside the grit:lab campus). Your free personal github available remotely, and you can learn solutions remotely.
        </li>
        <li>
          Copy all your solutions into folder outside repository, before allow to any initiative person to help you make commits and pulls using terminal, because terminal is not safe absolutely. And in case of your helper fail, you will be victim, and the helper will be just surprised.
        </li>
        <li>
          If vscode requires "pull", before do it, copy all visible files (your code/solutions) from repository folder into another folder, for emergency case, to always have backup.
        </li>
        <li>
          When create repository, check the option "initialize repository. Add readme ..." .
        </li>
        <li>
          The "vscode" has integrated terminal tab, which works the similar way as system terminal. On macos press "Command + j" to show/hide panel with terminal tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>After clone repository, you must once configure the repository</b>(in terminal), add desirable name and desirable email, to identify your self inside git(f.e. if someone will collaborate with you or send message).
          Open terminal in repository folder(repository path):
          <br>type "git config user.name desirablenamewithoutspaces" press Enter.
          <br>type "git config user.email your_Email_You_Used_For_Gritlab_Site_Login_To_Pass_Puzzle_Etc" press Enter.
        </li>
