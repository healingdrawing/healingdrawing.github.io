  <br>

  <br><br>1- Сергей Иванов (Sergei Ivanov 02.03.1983).

  <br><br>2- Александр Алишин (Alexander Alishin 09.09.1983),
  <br>his father, a policeman, knew about what was happening.
  <br>Dastards the scoundrels did not attack or threaten him,
  <br>since they knew that his father was a policeman.
  <br>And his father told him, that it was none of his business,
  <br>since his son is fine and in general he works in another area.

  <br><br>3- Евгений Маленков (Evgeny Malenkov),
  <br>his mother complained to various authorities,
  <br> with zero result, after that, he transferred to another school
  <br> in the middle of the school year.

  <br><br>4- Павел Васин(Pavel Vasin 29.06.1983).

  <br><br>5- Илья Резников(Ilya Reznikov).

  <br><br>6- Михаил Мечтаев(Mikhail Mechtaev 14.04.1983).

  <br><br>7- Дмитрий Першуткин(Dmitry Pershutkin 12.03.1983).

  <br><br>8- Анастасия Анашкина(Anastasia Anashkina),
  <br>as i know, she is Alexander Mikhailov's wife.
  <br>She saw me being attacked by a flock,
  <br>before a history lesson and other episodes of threatening etc.

  <br>
  <br><br>1- Гуляков Игорь Александрович (Gulyakov Igor Alexandrovich), physical education teacher

  <br><br>2- Жукова Ирина Олеговна (Zhukova Irina Olegovna), biology teacher

  <br><br>3- Сергей Иванов(Sergei Ivanov) - after the characters (1) and (2) conspired and publicly humiliated my
  dignity by deliberately worsening the result of my physical education exam in grade 11 (after that they handed a medal
  to another student and many noticed this crime, including one teacher who is not on this a photo). I decided not to
  take a fresh photo for this group photo. I also decided not to attend prom after finishing 11th grade. They took
  revenge on me because I did not want to fulfill their personal desires that go beyond educational activities. They
  failed to use me and they harmed me in collusion. In my opinion, this was the idea of character (2).
  <br>As a result, my photo (3) is old, about 1996-1997. This photo was given to them by my genetic mother. In year
  1998, in beginning of summer, I cut my hair bald, with a trimmer. Some of photos from 1998+ are shown below.

  <br>1- Sergei Ivanov
  <br>
  <br>2- Anatoly Khomenko (Анатолий Хоменко) - father of one of the team players. Later(before the next stage of the
  competition), Evgeny Konyagin tried to borrow
  money from Anatoly Khomenko in order to take his wife with the team to Kislovodsk (competitions were held there), to a
  resort, to relax. They didn't lend him money. A little later, Evgeny Konyagin suddenly had money, but one of the
  players of the main team had to stay at home and miss the competition (Russian championship among youths). Instead,
  another went to the competition. It was a weak player, in whose house a new invited player from another city lived for
  free, for several weeks. Previously, money was allocated for the living of this player. It is not difficult to draw
  conclusions.
