    <h3>
      1. Rollback the platform settings close to original condition(like it was at the beginning of the curriculum in 2022), before "genius" decision of the grit:lab administration.
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      This changes should be implemented, to avoid as possible human factor domination from side of the students(but not only students), and finally prevent or at least decrease weird activity and persuiting personal needs, such as scam, bullying/intimidation when administration knows about it and do ... nothing or even satisfying needs of bastards, just to keep silence(<a href="/g">proofs and description</a>, and believe me there is lot of other cases, includes cases i observed from side but was not involved directly).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Original condition of platform (for auditors case, persons who need to check another person project) was:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every student could have more than one project(in same time) to try to audit that increase audit ratio scores.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So the student could choose the preferable way to make a progress(complete audits and unlock the next project, locked before, in some reasons according to very specific idea of platform creators).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      During the first months of the curriculum, some students(include described above in "proofs and description" section) demonstrated weird behavior and dirty way of thinking, and other students started to avoid them as possible. After that these bastards started crap everywhere and produce noise in grit:lab administration about they have difficults with progress. In some reasons grit:lab administration, instead of take responsibility to fix the situation by them self and explain to bastards that they should manage their behavior more polite and respectful to other students, desided to satisfy needs of the bastards and harm other students by forcing other students "eat the shit of the bastards". The administration spoiled the platform, and some changes were implemented.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Spoiled condition of platform (for auditors case, persons who need to check another person project) is:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every student could have only one project(in same time) to try to audit that increase audit ratio scores.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      According to spoiled platform settings, until the submitter pass the project, the auditor, from the list of 10 auditors for the project, can not audit another projects, and forced to interact with potential bastard(as negative case), without any variants. Or wait at least two weeks, with some chance to not be added to the same list again, after automatic refresh.
      And it is direct spoiling of the system from the side of the grit:lab administration, which announced the system as full autonomous.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After this spoiling, the platform became easily manipulative and unflexible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any student can submit not needed non-mandatory project, and keep locked 10 students about two weeks(which i already observed). And this condition is not result of hacking and not a brutforcing. It is result of management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, if any student will submit 3 non-mandatory projects, without plans to pass them, because it is not needed, since one student(in same time) can have only one project(after system was spoiled by grit:lab administration) 30 students can be locked at least for two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      After audit list refreshed, situation can be repeated with high chance, because students will be just moved to another one project, from submitted trap projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      And 30 students is about 50% of all the students in curriculum.
    </p>

    <h3>
      2. Separate the mandatory projects from the optional projects, as announced in requirements, to allow proper planning, and avoid student misinformation.
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      Announced requirements(one of the announcements):
      <hr>
      <img src="/g/img/requirements.png" alt="">
      <hr>
      <img src="/g/img/requirements-pic.png" alt="">
    </p>
    
    <p>
      At the moment from year 2022, it is impossible to pass only mandatory projects, because the projects are locked, and to unlock the next mandatory project you must complete not only previous mandatory project, but also a lot of side tasks which announced like optional.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is not 6 mandatory projects for Golang, but 15, then say this and allow to students properly schedule the time. The educational process should not smells like Indian quality level deal, otherwise the reputation will be affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also some of the pseudo optional projects(which is mandatory finally) absolutely unrelated on the mandatory projects from announced mandatory projects list. They are just the separated projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is about Golang, JavaScript, Rust branches, so it is not a ... mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>This is direct desinformation of the student.</b>
      And do not tell me this is the planned functionality of the curriculum. When you feed the dog using shit, finally you will train shiteater.
    </p>
    <p>
      In big industry with big money, if the company ordered the service and payed for this, and finally requires x2 times more stuff must be completed with the scheduled time with the same payment, it will rise a court case, with potential big money penalty or additional payments. After that the company will have very specific reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look at India experience. In the past, their coders make low quality of everything, and they got reputation of planetary scale. Now they still suffer from the shadows of their reputation. And most people know, if the code made in India, you need test it extra 3 times, before buy, and always be careful. If it is "Indie game" this means it poor and cheap with lot of bugs. But it still can be interesting for specific auditory.

    <h3>
      3. Change tasks description to lot of projects to fix direct errors, and redirect task targets from abstract vacuum to satisfying needs of dynamic IT industry.
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      The most of the tasks contain errors, and low quality content such as not clear description. Also, few months ago the head/leader of development team
      <a href="https://github.com/davhojt"> Dav Hojt </a>
      was fired from 01.
      As you can see, now his github account does not include info about he is part of 01-edu anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2023 Dav Hojt visited the grit:lab. Without invitation, he set near me, interrupted me from reading, and started conversation about things interesting for him. Finally he said it was the most usefull conversation during his visit. Later, nothing from i told to him was changed. So his target looks like was just a simulation of activity or some reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fix any single task and make it correct and clear, the three days or less required.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the task is just a text generally, so it easy to fix. During at least last two years nobody fix it, so it is not a mistake, it is trending to do nothing properly, and just say it is responsibility of another employee or even students.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case of hundreds of the students used to fix one task it is just a "genius" idea it is like in same time:
      <ul>
        <li>
          use the cat to protect the milk.
        </li>
        <li>
          throw the attractive prostitute into the squad of hungry stressed solders.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <b>These fixes should be implemented:</b>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Update the tasks(include audit) to satisfy industrial needs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the tasks(include audit)clear and consistent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fix direct errors.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>
      1. Update the tasks(include audit) to satisfy industrial needs.
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      At the moment the most tasks not aimed to satisfy industrial needs. The tasks looks like the product of some persons imagination/originality. Also tasks restrictions often <b>forcing the student follow the worst approach of coding</b>, such as:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use methods and techniques which is danger(low sequrity) for the final product(requirement to implement "cgi" in the Rust branch task "localhost").
        </li>
        <li>
          Use old libraries already replaced by more modern and not allow to use another more modern libraries used in industry.
          <img src="img/must-not-use.png" alt="">
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not use any usefull modern libraries at all, and make full code from scratch, which is absolute guarantee of low quality result, because students are not skilled enough to write high quality code and approach is wrong and useless later, since the students in the process of coding do not learn the using of popular libraries used in industry. Examples is several tasks in JavaScript branch (about gamedev in browser and forums "bomberman-dom", "real-time-forum", etc), at least Rust branch "localhost", "0-shell" tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          for the games requirement to provide 50+ fps(frames per seconds on screen) or higher. This weird rule, because fps can be related on current hardware + nobody will buy 50+fps, everybody will buy attractive experience(pictures, sounds, gameplay). No words. I personally not allowed to designer to add extra content into lobby, because it can affect fps, probably on 0.1 sec but it is enough for pretension from the side of special students... you know what i mean, if you read this document properly, and follow link "proofs and description" above. Also in all projects the visual effects and the music was decreased in quality as possible, because of fps requirement.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Finally student do not have skills and examples to demonstrate the usage of libraries required in industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In same time the announced qualification sounds close to full-stack <b>junior</b> developer.
      And juniors do not make code from scratch, like skilled command of coders, who desided to make new product/library for industry.
      <br>Juniors start from using frameworks, libraries, editing high level content, to do not harm the low level content, which is core of the project/product.
    </p>
    <p>
      To properly make low level content, which will be used later on high level, the creator must have the vision(global and detailed), experience and skills, higher then junior. Otherwise the project code design have all the chances to be implemented wrong way, with later refactoring, up to many of extra repetitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Restrictions must be removed as possible , to make the project more flexible and dynamic , to satisfy the dynamic IT industry.</b> Student can easily analyze the vacancy requirements and use libraries in project, to get skills, which can be demonstrated later as suitable.
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      2. Make the tasks(include audit)clear and consistent.
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      Description and audit questions must be implemented as possible simply to read and understand. Audit sequence must be implemented consistently as possible to avoid situations like below(observed personally lot of times with difference in details):
      
      <br>(inside project which implementation of the private forum, where user must have access to content only after correct login):
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ttry register new user. Was user registered without errors? - yes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Login using new user credentials. Was user logged in without errors? - yes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to create post. Was post created, that you can see it? - yes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try logout from the application. Was user logged out? - yes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to comment the post. Was comment added, that you can see it? - no.
        </li>
        <b>Because logout was before, and this is fail of audit.</b> Because the sequence is wrong. And if someone will say, "ignore the question sequence in this place, just login again before try to make the comment", then why do not ignore everything else uncomfortable in audit, if i am fine with my project i like it, i am satisfied be result?
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h4>
      3. Fix direct errors (mistypings, wrong numbers, holes in content, broken logical sequences) in task and audit question sequences.
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      Edit the text with responsibility and understanding of the material. It is not a solution(no coding solutions inside) it is generally an English text.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Conclusion.
    </h2>
    
    <p>
      All of the above changes are cosmetic in nature and do not change the platform too much. Feel free to contact the author for details. I am willing to implement this on a contract or permanent basis for at least one year for mandatory projects. At the moment I am on the island and do not plan to leave it without reason.
    </p>

      <h3>
        This project is great initiative. Even if nothing will be implemented finally, i would like that you try to keep it alive. For some people it is close to miracle opportunity.
