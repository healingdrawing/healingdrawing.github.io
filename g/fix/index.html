      <ol>
        <li>
          Rollback the platform settings close to original condition(like it was at the beginning of the curriculum in september 2022), before "genius" initiative of grit:lab administration, to avoid as possible human factor domination from side of the students(but not only students), and finally prevent or at least decrease weird activity and persuiting personal needs, such as scam, bullying/intimidation when administration knows about it and do ... nothing or even satisfying needs of bastards, just to keep silence(proofs and description below).
        </li>
        <li>
          Separate the mandatory project from optional projects, as announced: "You must complete at least mandatory projects of curriculum", to allow proper planning, and avoid students missinformation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Change tasks description to lot of projects to fix direct errors, and redirect task targets from abstract vacuum to satisfying needs of dynamic IT industry.
        </li>
