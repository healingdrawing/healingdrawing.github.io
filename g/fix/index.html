    <h3>
      1. Rollback the platform settings close to original condition(like it was at the beginning of the curriculum in 2022), before "genius" decision of the grit:lab administration.
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      This changes should be implemented, to avoid as possible human factor domination from side of the students(but not only students), and finally prevent or at least decrease weird activity and persuiting personal needs, such as scam, bullying/intimidation when administration knows about it and do ... nothing or even satisfying needs of bastards, just to keep silence(<a href="/g">proofs and description</a>, and believe me there is lot of other cases, includes cases i observed from side but was not involved directly).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Original condition of platform (for auditors case, persons who need to check another person project) was:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every student could have more than one project(in same time) to try to audit that increase audit ratio scores.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So the student could choose the preferable way to make a progress(complete audits and unlock the next project, locked before, in some reasons according to very specific idea of platform creators).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      During the first months of the curriculum, some students(include described above in "proofs and description" section) demonstrated weird behavior and dirty way of thinking, and other students started to avoid them as possible. After that these bastards started crap everywhere and produce noise in grit:lab administration about they have difficults with progress. In some reasons grit:lab administration, instead of take responsibility to fix the situation by them self and explain to bastards that they should manage their behavior more polite and respectful to other students, desided to satisfy needs of the bastards and harm other students by forcing other students "eat the shit of the bastards". The administration spoiled the platform, and some changes were implemented.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>Spoiled condition of platform (for auditors case, persons who need to check another person project) is:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Every student could have only one project(in same time) to try to audit that increase audit ratio scores.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      According to spoiled platform settings, until the submitter pass the project, the auditor, from the list of 10 auditors for the project, can not audit another projects, and forced to interact with potential bastard(as negative case), without any variants. Or wait at least two weeks, with some chance to not be added to the same list again, after automatic refresh.
      And it is direct spoiling of the system from the side of the grit:lab administration, which announced the system as full autonomous.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After this spoiling, the platform became easily manipulative and unflexible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any student can submit not needed non-mandatory project, and keep locked 10 students about two weeks(which i already observed). And this condition is not result of hacking and not a brutforcing. It is result of management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, if any student will submit 3 non-mandatory projects, without plans to pass them, because it is not needed, since one student(in same time) can have only one project(after system was spoiled by grit:lab administration) 30 students can be locked at least for two weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      After audit list refreshed, situation can be repeated with high chance, because students will be just moved to another one project, from submitted trap projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      And 30 students is about 50% of all the students in curriculum.
    </p>
